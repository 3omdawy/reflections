How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It minimized the area to look for

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Know exactly what changed from each version to the other (evolution over
	time)

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: create commits only in important point of time --> not too many versions
	to check for changes
	Cons: some changes can go past the version control (i.e. cannot be retrieved)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Some changes are related to multiple files so they should be checked-in
	together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: shows the full history of commits
	git diff: shows differences between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Much more confident .. because I can get back at any time and know where the
	problem is

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    My work
