When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

+ To be able to share my code with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

+ Because someone else may be contributing to the code and I don't want to merge with thim at that time
