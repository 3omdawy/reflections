When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

+ To be able to share my code with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

+ Because someone else may be contributing to the code and I don't want to merge with thim at that time

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

+ Branch: when I need to make some modifications away from the master branch that everyone gets
+ Fork: on GitHub to copy a repository into a new place (when I want to start from someone else's repository)
+ Clone: to copy a repository locally or from GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

+ Knowing the changes done by other people in the remote while I was working offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

+ Without configuration control SW, someone should always merge the work of people .. Git and GitHub
are certainly a better way
