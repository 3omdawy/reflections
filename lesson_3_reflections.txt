When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

+ To be able to share my code with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

+ Because someone else may be contributing to the code and I don't want to merge with thim at that time

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

+ Branch: when I need to make some modifications away from the master branch that everyone gets
+ Fork: on GitHub to copy a repository into a new place (when I want to start from someone else's repository)
+ Clone: to copy a repository locally or from GitHub
